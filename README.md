# ALS
A matrix decomposition algorithm that uses alternating training to obtain a set of user and item embeddings that approximates the original user-item matrix by means of an embedding dot product.

# BPR
It provides an optimization function. Instead of predicting the ratings of specific user and item pairs, it ranks the items consumed by users according to their preferences.

# KNN

# SLIM


# VAE
It is a variational autoencoder architecture that first projects sparse user interaction vectors onto a potential distribution space, which is later used to generate probability distributions for all items.MultiVAE employs polynomial likelihood and different regularization procedures involving linear annealing.
